</div>
<p>The most historic piece of furniture in
historic Williamsburg today is the throne-like
Speaker&rsquo;s Chair that stands in the far
end of the House of Burgesses.</p>
<p>It is the very same chair that stood there
when the portly Peyton Randolph was speaker of the
House, and men like George Mason and Thomas Jefferson
and Patrick Henry raised aloft in that chamber the banner
of human liberty.</p>
<p>The same chair was probably there in 1759, too, when a
newly elected burgess stood in his place to receive the
plaudits of the House for his bravery in the French and
Indian War. From it Speaker John Robinson came to the
embarrassed young man&rsquo;s rescue with the words: &ldquo;Sit down,
Mr. Washington; your modesty is equal to your valour,
and that surpasses the power of any language I possess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the Speaker&rsquo;s Chair was among the &ldquo;several
other things&rdquo; that were saved&mdash;along with the colony&rsquo;s
records and the portraits of the royal family&mdash;when flames
gutted the Capitol in 1747. If so, this chair <i>may</i> be the
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
very one installed when the Capitol building was first
completed in 1705. The Assembly had specified that the
burgesses&rsquo; chamber should &ldquo;be furnished with a large
Armed Chair for the Speaker to sit in, and a cushion stuft
with hair Suitable to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because of these historic associations the Speaker&rsquo;s Chair
may seem a most fitting key to open this account of furniture
making in colonial Williamsburg. Its true aptness to the
topic, however, lies in other circumstances: No one knows
who made the chair or where it was made or even when it
was made. And this kind of uncertainty pervades the entire
subject of cabinetmaking in eighteenth-century Virginia.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig1">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="362" />
<p class="pcap"><i>A sketch of the Speaker&rsquo;s Chair, reproduced
full size from the 1777 journal
of Ebenezer Hazard, a New England
bookseller, historian, and surveyor
general of the Post Office.</i></p>
</div>
<p>To continue for a moment with the same example, the
Speaker&rsquo;s Chair has the kind of scrolled arms frequently
found on William and Mary
furniture&mdash;a style that in 1700
was passing out of fashion in
England. Its simple cabriole
legs, with smooth knees and
round feet, are typical of the
early Queen Anne style just
then coming into English
fashion. The chair bears an
overall resemblance, furthermore,
to the one that stood
in the House of Commons, as
shown in contemporary prints. Finally, a great many items
for the construction and furnishing of the Williamsburg
Capitol were ordered from London.</p>
<p>All these circumstances give strong reason to think that
the chair came from England. But they do not prove that
it did. In fact, the stylistic concepts and the workmanship
are such as might well have come from the shop of a
Williamsburg cabinetmaker endeavoring, after the fire of
1747, to reproduce the original chair from memory.</p>
<p>The fact that it is constructed in part of American
black walnut might seem to prove that the chair was made,
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
if not in Williamsburg, at least in the American colonies.
Unfortunately, it proves nothing of the kind. Because,
among other reasons, they had found the American variety
less susceptible to &ldquo;the worm&rdquo; than English walnut, English
cabinetmakers preferred the American wood and used it
extensively.</p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>GOODLY TALL TREES</i></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Wheresoever we landed upon this [the James] River, wee
saw the goodliest Woods as Beech, Oke, Cedar, Cypresse,
Wal-nuts, Sassafras, ... and other Trees unknowne,&rdquo;
wrote George Percy, one of the original Jamestown colonists
in 1607. Captain John Smith, who explored and mapped
both Virginia and New England, recorded that &ldquo;all the
Countrey is overgrowne with trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indian clearings, even those made in the course of fire-hunting,
were infinitesimal in the vast extent of the woods.
The white man&rsquo;s efforts made a bigger dent, but after a
century of English settlement the Reverend Hugh Jones
could still report that Virginia was &ldquo;one continuous forest.&rdquo;
And the same was true of the whole Atlantic coastal area&mdash;to
say nothing of the wilderness beyond the mountains.</p>
<p>The size of the individual trees in this primeval forest
rarely failed to excite comment, beginning with George
Percy&rsquo;s mention of the &ldquo;goodly tall Trees&rdquo; he saw near
Cape Henry, the Jamestown settlers&rsquo; first landing site.
With an unlimited supply of very wide boards to be had
for the sawing, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century colonial
cabinetmakers found good use for them in table tops and
leaves, and the sides and tops of chests. Boards were often
18 to 20 inches wide, and sometimes they measured as much
as two feet in width. In colonial days even wild cherry
sometimes stood 100 feet tall and four feet thick.</p>
<p>Up and down the coast of America grew an enormous
variety of trees, both evergreen and deciduous. All of them
found some use in the colonial home, from rough-hewn
structural members to finely crafted furniture&mdash;and even
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
to common hairbrushes and combs. In 1774 William Aylett
of King William County, 50 miles from Williamsburg,
advertised:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PLANK and SCANTLING to be sold by the Subscriber
at his Saw Mill near <i>Aylett</i>&rsquo;s Warehouse,
<i>Mattapony</i> River, upon the most reasonable Terms,
and of the following Kinds, <i>viz.</i> White Oak, Black
Walnut, Sweet Gum, Ash, Poplar, Birch (which makes
elegant Furniture) best Yellow Heart Pine for Flooring,
and clear of Heart and Sap if required, common high
Land and Slash Pine for other Uses....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost anything could be made of wood, and almost
everything was, including many of the articles we today
are familiar with in steel, iron, copper, aluminum, alloys,
plastics, and rubber. Pitchforks, tableware and kitchen
utensils, wheels, axles, gears and bearings, tool handles
and sometimes the bodies of tools, all were made, at least
in part, of wood.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>THE WOODWORKING CRAFTS</i></span></h2>
<p>The variety of woodworking crafts was almost as great as
the variety of trees. In Williamsburg alone&mdash;and Williamsburg
was by no means an important center in this respect&mdash;mention
has been found of all the following during colonial
times:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>cabinetmaker</dt>
<dt>carpenter</dt>
<dt>carver</dt>
<dt>chairmaker</dt>
<dt>chaisemaker</dt>
<dt>chariotmaker</dt>
<dt>coachmaker</dt>
<dt>cooper</dt>
<dt>gunstocker</dt>
<dt>joiner</dt>
<dt>millwright</dt>
<dt>sawyer</dt>
<dt>shipwright</dt>
<dt>wheelwright</dt>
<dt>woodcutter</dt></dl>
<p>In addition, there were such related crafts as upholsterer,
lumber merchant, gilder, japanner, and coach painter.</p>
<p>Eighteenth-century Williamsburg was not, however, quite
so crowded with woodworking craftsmen as this list would
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
indicate. For if the guild traditions of the Old World required
that each operation be the monopoly of a specific
craft, in the New World practical needs tended to force a
merging of related crafts. Only in a few of the big colonial
cities&mdash;Philadelphia, New York, Boston, or Charleston&mdash;was
demand great enough to keep some of the specialists
going. Elsewhere the craftsmen of town or village had to
be versatile&mdash;or go hungry. A Williamsburg cabinetmaker,
thus, was likely to be also joiner, carver, and upholsterer&mdash;and
probably undertaker as well.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>This illustration from Diderot&rsquo;s famous eighteenth-century encyclopedia of the arts and sciences
shows the interior and lumber yard of a large European joinery. Workers inside the shop are
making, carving, and fitting various elements of paneling. Outside, to the right, two others are
ripping a length of scantling with a pit saw.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Right here it may be well to explain the difference between
joinery and cabinetmaking as crafts, always remembering
that in Williamsburg and in most of colonial America both
might be practiced by the same craftsmen. Joinery involved
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
the making and installing of paneling, molding, mantel-pieces,
staircases, and similar interior trim in houses. A
joiner might also make furniture of the plainer sort. Cabinetmaking
demanded skills of a higher order to create furniture
having such refinements as curved surfaces, dovetail joints,
cabriole legs, carved ornamentation, veneered or inlaid surfaces,
and upholstering.</p>
<p>Joiner and cabinetmaker were both concerned basically
with fitting together pieces of wood to make a whole
structure. The pieces or parts had to be shaped, of course;
and it was in the shaping processes&mdash;sawing, planing, and
chiseling&mdash;that the worker&rsquo;s real skill showed up. Pieces
properly formed will fit together neatly and enduringly,
while no amount of glue will make a sound joint of pieces
that do not fit.</p>
<p>Two crafts always prominent in Europe are noticeably
absent from the list of Williamsburg woodworking crafts.
Marquetry, the intricate inlaying of patterns in contrasting
woods, seems not to have been much practiced anywhere
on this side of the Atlantic; probably Williamsburg cabinetmakers
were rarely, if ever, called on for inlay work. The
absence of turnery from the list, however, does not mean
it was unknown here but only that Williamsburg cabinetmakers
customarily did their own lathe work instead of
sending it out to a specialist.</p>
<p>Here, too, may be the best place to make first acquaintance
of the four Williamsburg practitioners about whom
most information survives. They&mdash;and the periods of their
known activity as cabinetmakers in Williamsburg&mdash;are:
<i>Peter Scott</i>, 1732-75, who lived across the street from
Bruton Parish Church and had his shop somewhere nearby,
and who was, for forty years, a member of Williamsburg&rsquo;s
common council; <i>Anthony Hay</i>, 1751-67, whose &ldquo;large
Cabinet Maker&rsquo;s Shop&rdquo; has been re-created on its original
Nicholson Street site, who turned innkeeper as host of the
Raleigh Tavern, and whose son George, as United States
attorney, prosecuted Aaron Burr for treason; <i>Edmund
Dickinson</i>, 1764-78, who probably worked in Hay&rsquo;s shop
and eventually occupied it as his own master; and <i>Benjamin
Bucktrout</i>, 1766-78, whose funeral side line became the
chief business of his posterity in Williamsburg for several
generations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>PRIME FURNITURE WOODS</i></span></h2>
<p>When Anthony Hay died in 1770, his executors advertised
for sale his two lots on Nicholson Street including a dwelling
house, shop, and &ldquo;Timber Yard.&rdquo; The reader should
not assume from the words &ldquo;timber yard&rdquo; that Hay (and
his successors at the same location on Nicholson Street,
Bucktrout and Dickinson) supplied lumber to the town&rsquo;s
other users. Probably it was stocked only for the proprietor&rsquo;s
own use. In any event, the kinds of raw material that
would have been piled in Hay&rsquo;s yard can be guessed fairly
easily.</p>
<p>As we shall presently see, no surviving piece of eighteenth-century
furniture can be positively traced to Hay or any
other Williamsburg maker. But every piece having a possible
claim to local origin, including the Speaker&rsquo;s Chair, contains
either walnut or mahogany as the primary wood. Similarly,
few documentary records survive to tell about the furniture
actually made in Williamsburg shops and they do not
always mention the kinds of wood used. Where they do,
however, walnut and mahogany are invariably specified.
Finally, archaeological excavation at the site of the Hay
cabinet shop turned up a roughed-out table leg dating
probably from Dickinson&rsquo;s occupancy. Quite well preserved
in the damp silt of the stream bed, it was easily identified
as walnut. All things considered, therefore, Hay&rsquo;s timber
yard would surely have contained ample supplies of both
walnut and mahogany.</p>
<p>American black walnut, known in England as &ldquo;Virginia
walnut,&rdquo; had been the most important of native woods to
the colonial cabinetmaker since the seventeenth century.
Strong, durable, hard enough to resist surface marring in
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
daily use but still easy to work and carve, it shows a handsome
grain, has a lovely color, and takes an excellent finish.</p>
<p>Known and infrequently used earlier, mahogany began
to arrive in quantity both in the colonies and the mother
country about 1725. In England, by the middle of the
century, it had pushed aside walnut as a furniture wood.
Mahogany never rose to the same pre-eminence in the
colonies because other fine woods were so readily available.
Mahogany was imported from Jamaica and Honduras
legally, from Santo Domingo and Cuba illicitly via Jamaica.
The wood from each source differed variously in its characteristic
graining, color, strength, hardness, and workability.
That from Santo Domingo, known as &ldquo;Spanish
mahogany,&rdquo; was considered most desirable.</p>
<p>The wood of the wild black cherry was a favorite among
Connecticut cabinetmakers, as it was farther south too,
because of its natural strength, close grain, warm color, and
resistance to splitting and warping. Peter Kalm, the Swedish
botanist who visited Philadelphia in 1748, wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Joiners say that among the trees of this country
they chiefly use the wild cherry trees, and the curled
maple.... The wood of the wild cherry-trees (Prunus
Virginiana) is very good, and looks exceedingly well,
it has a yellow color, and the older the furniture is,
of which is made of it, the better it looks. But it is
already difficult to get at it, for they cut it everywhere,
and plant it nowhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hay&rsquo;s yard might well have had some cherry in its piles
of lumber, though probably not in great quantity. It might
also have included a bit of maple&mdash;a primary favorite in
New England&mdash;perhaps in some choice pieces showing the
bird&rsquo;s eye, curly, wavy, blister, or quilted grain patterns
that often occur in this wood.</p>
<p>In addition, cedar, hickory, ash, beech, birch, oak, elm,
locust, apple, holly, and other hard woods might have been
present in the Nicholson Street timber yard in small
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
amounts. All could have found appropriate use in some
kind of cabinetry.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><i>SECONDARY MATERIALS</i></span></h2>
<p>A piece of furniture need not be made entirely of prime
wood, and rarely was. In the parlor of the Brush-Everard
House in Williamsburg, for example, stands a sofa made in
Philadelphia about 1770; it has eight legs that show, made
of mahogany, and a frame that does not show, constructed
of chestnut, maple, pine, and tulip poplar. Not every article
can boast so many secondary woods, though the colonial
cabinetmaker had a wide choice. The secretary-bookcase
in the library of the same house was possibly made in
Williamsburg and shows the more usual combination of
walnut and pine as primary and secondary woods.</p>
<p>Colonial cabinetmakers customarily selected a secondary
wood that answered the construction requirements of the
article in question and that was locally available and therefore
cheap. The secondary wood in a piece of colonial
furniture is often the best clue to the place where it was
made. Yellow pine and tulip poplar were most often used in
Virginia and the other southern colonies; Hay and his
successors would doubtless have stocked goodly amounts
of both, and very likely also some white cedar and cypress.</p>
<p>Probably no list of the materials that might have been
used in colonial cabinetry can hope to be complete. None,
certainly, could pretend to completeness that did not
include a word about nails, screws, glue, and cabinet hardware.</p>
<p>The colonial cabinetmaker used heated animal glue regularly.
It was indispensable for veneering; for attaching
carved surfaces and ornaments to their plain foundations
it was almost as important; and any joint, however carefully
made, was stouter for a bit of adhesive.</p>
<p>The eighteenth-century upholsterer, of course, could not
have done his work without brass tacks, and quantities
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
of them have been found in the course of archaeological
excavation at the site of the Hay-Bucktrout-Dickinson
cabinet shop on Nicholson Street. The colonial cabinetmaker
sometimes used small nails for such special purposes
as attaching drawer guides. But he would no more have
nailed together a piece of furniture than would his modern
counterpart. Screws he did use, for attaching cleats, braces,
hinges, or other hardware. He used as few as possible, however,
since all screws were handmade, probably imported,
and certainly not cheap. If a joint needed to be reinforced,
he used wooden pegs, not screws. (Treenails, used in house
framing, were simply large pegs.)</p>
<p>Even the simplest piece of case furniture&mdash;such as a
chest, press, bookcase, clock case, dressing table, or sideboard&mdash;needed
at least one lock and possibly a set of hinges
before it could leave the cabinetmaker&rsquo;s hands as a finished
article. These items of hardware could be of iron on the
cruder examples of cabinet work or of brass on the better
ones. The door handles, drawer pulls, escutcheon plates,
and other visible hardware on finer pieces were almost sure
to be of brass, to be designed for ornament as well as
utility, and to be imported.</p>
<p>A number of brass hardware items&mdash;whole and cut-down
hinges and escutcheon plates in particular&mdash;have been
excavated at the site of the Hay shop, most of them in
ground levels associated with Dickinson&rsquo;s tenure. These
seem to say that Dickinson was accustomed to working
with fine furniture.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><i>SCRAPS OF EVIDENCE</i></span></h2>
<p>A great deal of authentic eighteenth-century furniture&mdash;both
English and American in origin&mdash;has been assembled
for display in the Exhibition Buildings of restored Williamsburg.
The collection is acknowledged to be one of the finest
in the country. Unfortunately, it contains not one stick
of furniture that can be positively identified as coming
from the hand of a Williamsburg cabinetmaker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>We do have, however, many bits and pieces of documentary
evidence about various Williamsburg cabinetmakers
of the colonial era and about the kind of work they
did. A number of them, for example, advertised their
services in the columns of the <i>Virginia Gazette</i> from time
to time. Practitioners of other crafts often listed at great
length the wares they made and sold; but the cabinetmakers
usually announced only that they stood ready to make to
order any kind of furniture. They were confidently versatile,
it would seem; that they kept busy making and doing all
sorts of things is corroborated by other scraps of written
and printed information.</p>
<p>Joshua Kendall, when he set up
shop in Williamsburg, offered to
make &ldquo;<i>Venetian</i> SUN BLINDS for
windows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="297" height="501" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Venetian blinds were widely
made and used in both the
Old World and the New.
This how-to-do-it illustration
also comes from Diderot&rsquo;s
encyclopedia.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In 1755 Peter Scott announced
that he intended to leave for England
and would sell his house and lots,
&ldquo;Two Negroes, bred to the Business
of a Cabinet-Maker,&rdquo; and &ldquo;sundry
Pieces of Cabinet Work, of Mahogany
and Walnut, consisting of Desks,
Book-Cases, Tables of various Sorts,
Tools, and some Materials.&rdquo; Apparently
his plan did not materialize,
for when he died 20 years later his
estate included &ldquo;A great variety of
cabinet makers tools, Mahogany,
Walnut, Pine Plank, like wise new
walnut book cases, desks, tables, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From personal account books of
John Mercer, lawyer, and Robert Carter of Nomini Hall,
planter and councilor, we know that Scott made a set
of book shelves for the former and twice repaired tables
for him, and that he made two card tables, one sideboard,
and four picture frames for the latter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>In 1772 Benjamin Bucktrout submitted a bill for services
to the same Robert Carter of Nomini Hall. It is worth
quoting in full:</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Putting together these and other bits and pieces, several
conclusions seem warranted: Williamsburg cabinetmakers
made furniture not only to order but for open sale in their
shops; they probably spent more time repairing furniture
than in making it; they were by no means too proud to
undertake such incidental jobs as putting up and taking
down bedsteads and curtains. Finally, they were capable of
producing any and all of the major items of furniture:
chairs, beds, chests, desks, bookcases, clothes and china
presses, tables, and candlestands.</p>
<p>While perhaps not all of them would have had occasion
to make every variety of the less common articles, some
doubtless were called on for spinning wheels, bootjacks,
bowls and trenchers, cradles, toys, tools, coffins, spice
chests, fire screens, music stands, trunks, cellarettes,
looking-glass frames, and so on and on.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><i>THE LATEST LONDON STYLES</i></span></h2>
<p>Every swing in London fashions in clothing, music, wigs,
and the decorative arts was normally echoed a few years
later by a similar but muted swing in colonial fashions.
In each case the peak of the vogue (not necessarily the
first evidence of it) in the colonies came a decade or two
after the same style had reached its height in London.</p>
<p>The eighteenth century was the golden age of furniture
design in England. The decorative tastes of the Restoration
and of the reign of William and Mary set the stage for the
appearance at the opening of the century of the curvaceous
style known as Queen Anne. There followed a succession
of partly overlapping, sometimes ill-defined and sometimes
distinct styles in English furniture design and interior
design. These succeeding fashions have since become known
by the names of reigning monarchs or of men whose books
of collected designs set or summarized the predominant
taste of the years in question. We know these styles, and
style periods, as early and late Georgian, Chippendale,
Adam, Hepplewhite, and Sheraton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>In the American colonies the Queen Anne style did not
come into full flower until 1725 or thereabouts. The &ldquo;decorated
Queen Anne&rdquo; or early Georgian substyles cannot be
clearly discerned in colonial furniture before the advent of
&ldquo;Chippendale&rdquo; influence, about 1750, swept all before it.
Thomas Chippendale&rsquo;s famous <i>Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker&rsquo;s
Director</i>, published in 1754, was but one of a
number of books of designs issued in London and widely
used in colonial cabinetmaking shops. It was foremost
among them, however. And even if such characteristic
features of colonial Chippendale as the claw-and-ball foot,
for example, do not appear in Chippendale&rsquo;s book, his name
has become a label&mdash;perhaps ill-fitting&mdash;for the whole
middle period of colonial furniture making.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="380" />
<p class="pcap"><i><span class="large">Chairs.</span></i></p>
<p class="pcapc"><i>Three design chairs&mdash;the one to the right offering alternative treatments of certain
details&mdash;from Chippendale&rsquo;s</i> Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker&rsquo;s Director: Being a
large Collection of the Most Elegant and Useful Designs of Household Furniture,
in the Most Fashionable Taste. (<i>Third edition, London, 1762</i>)</p>
</div>
<p>This period lasted through the Revolution; the wartime
breach of relations with England all but cut off the transfer
to America of the Adam style that was the rage of London
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
in the 1770&rsquo;s. After the Revolution the designs of George
Hepplewhite and, late in the century, Thomas Sheraton
followed the usual route across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Throughout the century, too, some regional differences
can be discerned. New England followed old England in
social customs and tastes but with a tinge of stateliness
and a restraint of design in furniture that may have had
distant Puritan ancestry. In New York, certainly, the
ideas of the original Dutch settlers persisted in coloring
later English influences in matters of taste. German immigrants
to Pennsylvania brought sturdy non-English
preferences to the areas they settled outside Philadelphia.
The city itself, of course, always remained a cosmopolitan
center&mdash;if a somewhat sober one&mdash;whose furniture showed
the English origins of many of its chief makers.</p>
<p>The southern colonies, and particularly Virginia, were
more closely tied to the mother country in sentiment and
economy than were the others. Virginians, therefore,
probably mirrored English tastes more faithfully than many
of their compatriots.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><i>APRON-STRING EFFECTS</i></span></h2>
<p>English products were so much admired in Virginia, in
fact, and so easily obtained by those who could afford choice
things, that the local artisan had little chance to compete.
Whether cause or consequence of this lack of demand for
their services, Virginia cabinetmakers appear to have
been less highly skilled and less highly schooled in the
craft than their colleagues in London and in a number of
large colonial cities. There was no &ldquo;school&rdquo; of cabinetry in
eighteenth-century Williamsburg such as developed in
Philadelphia, Newport, Charleston, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>A Virginian who wanted fine furniture might order it
from one of these cities. More likely, he would buy it at a
sale of &ldquo;venture&rdquo; furniture made in a northern or middle
colony and shipped south to be sold for the best price it
would bring. Or, he could send to England for his wants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>This was not so difficult a transaction as might at first
appear. Tobacco was the source of Virginia&rsquo;s wealth, and
tobacco had to be shipped to England for sale. The typical
large Tidewater planter consigned his annual crop to an
English merchant who received, handled, and sold it.
After expense deductions, the balance in the merchant&rsquo;s
hands represented the planter&rsquo;s profits.</p>
<p>What was more natural than to spend it right there in
England? Articles of English make were thought (usually
with reason) to be of better material and workmanship
than &ldquo;country made&rdquo; pieces, and they were undeniably
more in fashion. The tobacco ships were returning to
Virginia anyway, needed freight for their holds, and could
unload almost at the planter&rsquo;s front door. As a result of
these circumstances, it was customary to send with each
shipment of tobacco an order for goods to be sent back.</p>
<p>This dependence on the English market did not prevail&mdash;at
least to the same extent&mdash;outside of the Chesapeake Bay
area. In consequence, cabinetmakers as far apart as Boston
and Charleston produced to order some very fine pieces of
furniture. Some few examples bear the maker&rsquo;s signature
or shop label; others can be identified with confidence
because of characteristic traits in their design or execution.
Cabinetmakers of the Townsend-Goddard dynasty in
Newport, Rhode Island, produced block-fronted and shell-carved
case pieces that sparkle in many museums today.
Thomas Affleck, Jonathan Gostelowe, Benjamin Randolph,
and others in Philadelphia made that city a center of
pre-Revolutionary cabinetry, and created the &ldquo;Philadelphia
Chippendale&rdquo; school of furniture design.</p>
<p>Virginia cabinetmakers, too, rarely labeled or signed
their products; or if they did, the products have not survived
in more than a very few examples. What is known to be
of Virginia origin is rarely ornate. The examples to be
seen in Williamsburg today, for instance, are truly provincial:
sturdy, generally well-proportioned, capably made,
and inclined to be simple in decoration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small"><i>MADE IN WILLIAMSBURG?</i></span></h2>
<p>In two of the bedrooms at the Brush-Everard House in
Williamsburg and in one at the Raleigh Tavern stand
commodious pieces of furniture that today would probably
have to be called cupboards. The eighteenth-century
housewife called them clothes presses, and they served
her as a place to keep the family&rsquo;s entire supply of bedding
and clothing not in daily use.</p>
<p>Two of these pieces are extremely simple in design, so
simple that they may be said to lack any conscious &ldquo;design&rdquo;
at all. Some two hundred years of use testify to the sturdiness
of their construction; but they were clearly not made
for show. The third&mdash;the one in the ground floor bedroom
of the Brush-Everard House&mdash;is more sophisticated. It is
of mahogany and southern pine rather than of walnut
and pine as are the other two. It has ogee-curved bracket
feet instead of straight bracket feet. And it boasts a nicely
made fretwork cornice.</p>
<p>These touches do not make it a distinguished piece of
furniture or an overly beautiful one. However, the importance
of these three pieces lies not in their appearance, but
rather in the fact that all three have been handed down from
generation to generation in the Galt family of Williamsburg
and are believed to have been made by one of the town&rsquo;s
eighteenth-century cabinetmakers.</p>
<p>Samuel Galt followed the watchmaking and silversmithing
craft in Williamsburg from 1750 until his death. His older
son, James, was also a silversmith until he became, in 1770,
the first &ldquo;keeper&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Lunatick Hospital&rdquo; in Williamsburg.
The younger son, John Minson Galt, acquired a
medical education in Edinburgh and London, then became
a partner in Dr. James Pasteur&rsquo;s apothecary and chirurgical
establishment in Williamsburg.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Galt family tradition does not say
which of Williamsburg&rsquo;s eighteenth-century craftsmen
created the articles in question. The most prominent
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
pre-Revolutionary cabinetmakers were all active during
some part of the period when the Galts, father and sons,
were founding the family&rsquo;s name and fame. It is possible,
judging from appearance alone, that the two simpler
pieces could have been made for the earliest Galt by the
earliest (known) cabinetmaker, Peter Scott, while the third
was constructed for a later and more pretentious household
by a later craftsman, perhaps Edmund Dickinson.</p>
<p>Dickinson was well equipped to make better furniture
than any of these three clothes presses. An apprentice in
Anthony Hay&rsquo;s cabinet shop on Nicholson Street, he may
have stayed on as journeyman during Benjamin Bucktrout&rsquo;s
proprietorship of the shop and timber yard. In any case,
he became master of the establishment himself in 1771.
Seven years later, serving as an officer in the Revolutionary
army, he was killed at the Battle of Monmouth.</p>
<p>The appraisers of Dickinson&rsquo;s estate&mdash;one of them was
Bucktrout&mdash;valued his possessions at the respectable total
of &pound;164 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> About &pound;20 of this represented Dickinson&rsquo;s
library of 40 volumes. Some of these had probably been
gathered by Hay in the first place, but it was still a large
and wide-ranging collection of books for a craftsman. In
addition to a copy of &ldquo;Chippendale&rsquo;s Designs&rdquo; valued by
itself at &pound;6, there were books of poetry and history, English
and French dictionaries, and many volumes of the <i>Tatler</i>,
the <i>Spectator</i>, and the <i>Connoisseur</i>.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small"><i>THE COMPLEAT TOOL CHEST</i></span></h2>
<p>Another section of the Dickinson inventory demands
particular attention here: the list of the cabinetmaker&rsquo;s
tools. These were valued by the appraisers at close to &pound;50,
and included 81 planes of different sorts, 11 saws, one stock
or brace and 20 bits, 63 chisels and gouges, four clamps and
a bench vise, a dozen miscellaneous items, and a tool box.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>No doubt most of these tools were made in England,
though the inventory does not say so. Perhaps all of them
were. Three years before Dickinson became master of his
shop&mdash;just about the time he would have been acquiring
many of his tools&mdash;John Blair, the acting governor of
the colony, reported to the Board of Trade in London that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our pig-iron and some bar-iron is chiefly shipped to
Britain. We do not make a saw, augur, gimlet, file or
nails, nor steel; and most tools in the country are imported
from Britain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inventory does not list hammers, files, or rasps of
any kind, which is surprising as they would have been
normal and necessary equipment in any woodworking
shop&mdash;and a number of the latter have been found at the
site of the Hay-Dickinson shop. Perhaps the appraisers
overlooked them.</p>
<p>However, the inventory does not list workbenches or
lathes either, which is the more surprising. A workbench
is an absolute necessity for cabinet work, a lathe only a
little less so, and neither is likely to be overlooked. It may
be that the appraisers did not list them as tools because
they were deemed to be permanent shop fixtures. At any
rate, while we have no proof that Dickinson owned either
a bench or a lathe, reason says he would have had at least
one of each. Matthew Tuell, a carpenter, owned a wheel
lathe and turning tools; and the partnership of Honey &amp;
Harrocks owned lathes, did their own turning, and possibly
turned for other cabinetmakers.</p>
<p>Eighteenth-century lathes were machine tools of a sort
but not &ldquo;power tools&rdquo; since human muscle provided their
motive force. Three varieties can be seen in the reconstructed
cabinet shop in Williamsburg: the bow lathe, the treadle
lathe, and the great wheel lathe. The last named is the
most impressive and the most effective, turning up some
700 rpm on the spindle with a good strong apprentice
cranking the large wheel.</p>
<p>The power woodworking lathe today is a considerably
more complicated machine, but the fundamental principles
involved in wood turning have not changed. Similarly, in the
other great category of woodworking tools&mdash;hand tools&mdash;each
separate operation is accomplished in precisely the
same way by tools that are basically the same as they were
in the eighteenth century, or even in the eighteenth century
B.C.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>With obvious exceptions, all woodworking tools are
intended primarily to remove small amounts of material
by some kind of cutting or tearing action. With this simple
fact in mind, it is no surprise to learn that saws, planes,
chisels, and boring tools found in ancient Egyptian tombs,
or depicted by artists of that time, were not significantly
different from those of the eighteenth century after Christ.
(Examples of furniture made in ancient Egypt, incidentally,
still exist, the oldest known articles being stools dating at
least from the First Dynasty&mdash;3500 B.C.!) Nor should it
be surprising to find that the colonial cabinetmaker&rsquo;s tools,
although cruder and less convenient than those sold in a
modern hardware store, were fundamentally the same and
did the same jobs in the same ways. Furthermore, in the
hands of a skilled craftsman the eighteenth-century tools
performed their assigned tasks every bit as well as do
their twentieth-century counterparts.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small"><i>PLAIN PLANES AND FANCY ONES</i></span></h2>
<p>If it appears that Dickinson&rsquo;s 81 planes were far more than
any cabinetmaker needed, the number is easily explained
by the likelihood that only a few were &ldquo;bench planes,&rdquo;
the rest being &ldquo;fitting-planes&rdquo; or specially shaped &ldquo;molding
planes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then as now the bench plane category included a group
of flat-bottomed planes used for smoothing, leveling, and
squaring pieces of wood. Varying in length from the smoothing
plane of about 6 inches to the jointer of perhaps 30
inches, the group included also the trying plane, long
plane, fore plane, jack plane, and strike block.</p>
<p>Fitting planes were those&mdash;each designed for a particular
purpose&mdash;used to prepare pieces of wood for fitting together.
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
This group included planes for making rabbets,
tongues, grooves, and similar shapes, and having such
names as the plough, match, fillister, and moving fillister.
The last was essentially a rabbet plane with an adjustable
fence to guide the width of its cut, often an adjustable
stop to regulate the depth of cut, and sometimes a routing
bit or tooth just ahead of the leading edge of the main blade.</p>
<p>The third and largest group in any eighteenth-century
tool collection included the molding planes for producing
ornamental trim in an almost infinite variety of shapes.
In the absence of machine-made millwork in stock sizes
and profiles, the colonial woodworker had to produce his
own. In some instances, he may even have made his own
molding planes first.</p>
<p>The eighteenth-century plane was a simple but effective
device. It had only three basic parts: a body, an iron, and
a wedge. The body or &ldquo;stock&rdquo; was a rectangular block of
beech (or some other hard wood) with a shaped vertical
opening through the center. The iron, inserted into this
opening, was held at the proper pitch and blade exposure
by tapping the wedge tightly into position. Handles were
usually attached to the larger planes.</p>
<p>On a bench plane the bottom or sole of the stock was flat,
of course, and this was particularly important for a jointer,
whose sole had to be perfectly true. But the sole of a molding
plane was shaped to fit the curve or angle or combination
of surfaces its blade would produce. Since even a simple
quarter-round molding might on occasion be needed in
several different sizes for different uses, the well-equipped
cabinetmaker would need perhaps nine planes right there.</p>
<p>George Washington&rsquo;s well-known order of goods from
London for the furnishing of Mount Vernon in 1759 included
in a long list of tools not only a considerable number
of bench and fitting planes, but about 50 molding planes:
&ldquo;10 pr Hollows &amp; Rounds, 4 two Square Asticles [astragals],
6 Ogees, 1 Snipes Bill, 4 Quarter Rounds, 4 Sash Plains,
3 Bead Ditto, 6 Ovelos.&rdquo; To these a cabinetmaker would
have added ogive, reed, flute, beaded flute, fillet and fascia
combinations, and other molding profiles favored on
eighteenth-century furniture. Remembering that a number
of these shapes too, might have been needed in more than
one size, Dickinson&rsquo;s 81 planes begin to seem hardly enough.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="859" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Several shapes of molding planes, with the irons of corresponding profile; also a moving fillister
in the lower part of the picture. This illustration and the two that follow it are taken from a
three-volume eighteenth-century French manual on woodworking by Andre-Jacob Roubo.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small"><i>BIG SAWS AND LITTLE CHISELS</i></span></h2>
<p>The familiar carpenter&rsquo;s handsaw, with a blade wide and
stiff enough to cut on the push stroke, was not unknown in
colonial times and Dickinson apparently had one. But
various kinds of frame and back saws were much more
common. Dickinson had one large frame saw&mdash;its valuation
at &pound;5 indicates it must have been of good quality as well as
good-sized&mdash;that was probably a pit saw. This was a
two-man affair for ripping logs into boards. A whip saw
(one of these was also listed) was like a modern two-man
crosscut saw.</p>
<p>Dickinson also possessed a small frame saw, a bow saw,
a &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; (tenon) saw, a panel saw, a sash saw, and three
dovetail saws. The latter three, called &ldquo;dovetailed&rdquo; in the
inventory, were back saws with short blades and very fine
teeth. The tenon saw might have been either a back or a
frame saw, as both varieties were used in cutting the tenons
for mortise joints. Vagaries in craft nomenclature leave us
in doubt about the precise appearance of many tools, including
Dickinson&rsquo;s panel and sash saws.</p>
<p>Except that it was doubtless made of wood rather than
steel and had a somewhat different chuck, Dickinson&rsquo;s bit
stock would have resembled the boring brace in any modern
tool box. His &ldquo;20 bitts,&rdquo; however, probably lacked the
spiral shank of their present descendants and thus required
considerably more skill on the part of the user to bore a
straight hole.</p>
<p>Chisels and gouges, of which Dickinson had a total of 53,
have not changed in appearance or structure over many
centuries. Like other tools, they come in different shapes
and sizes and some possess special designs for special purposes.
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
Of Dickinson&rsquo;s collection, 47 were carving chisels
and gouges, which argues that he did his own carving.
However, one of the two carvers known to have worked in
eighteenth-century Williamsburg was George Hamilton,
a journeyman in Dickinson&rsquo;s shop in 1774. The other,
James Wilson, worked with or for Anthony Hay some
twenty years earlier.</p>
<p>Dickinson&rsquo;s &ldquo;6 Morticeing Chissels&rdquo;&mdash;along with his
&ldquo;tenant&rdquo; saw and fitting planes&mdash;serve as reminders that
the basic techniques of cabinetmaking have likewise changed
little through the years.</p>
<p>In the making of an article of furniture the component
pieces must be attached to each other at various points:
sometimes side-by-side with grain running parallel, sometimes
end to end, or end into side, or crossing one another.
At each juncture the cabinetmaker had his choice of a
number of joints that were appropriate in such a situation.
The eighteenth-century craftsman knew them all and was
skilled in the making of all those used today: butt, lap,
rabbet, tongue and groove, mortise and tenon, mitre, dado,
dovetail, and their numerous combinations and variations.</p>
<p>In cabinetmaking the most useful joints are undoubtedly
the mortise and tenon and the dovetail, the former for
joining structural members at right angles, the latter for
holding together adjacent sides of drawers, chests, boxes,
and the like. Both kinds of joints are very strong if well
made, weak if poorly fitted. Skill and experience, thus,
were (and are) prerequisite to good furniture making.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small"><i>ON THE SURFACE</i></span></h2>
<p>Some veneering appeared on colonial furniture at least by
the beginning of the eighteenth century. But it was not
widely practiced, in part because fine cabinet woods were
relatively cheap and in part, no doubt, because making
veneer by hand required a good deal of skilled work and
labor was relatively expensive. In any case, it was the large
and otherwise unadorned surfaces of Hepplewhite and
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
Sheraton furniture that invited matched veneering. Since
these fashions came to America after the Revolution and
after Williamsburg had passed its apogee, Williamsburg
cabinetmakers probably did little if any veneering.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="435" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Two men with a good-sized but fine-toothed frame saw here cut a log into thin slices of veneer.</i>
<br /><span class="jr"><span class="small">ROUBO</span></span></p>
</div>
<p>Applying a finish to woodwork is an ancient art and has
always served two purposes: to give the wood a protective
coating and to enhance its appearance. By the eighteenth
century the techniques for applying several different kinds
of finish were well understood and widely used in the colonial
cabinet shop.</p>
<p>Painting, generally limited to the cheapest sort of furniture,
was little practiced by quality cabinetmakers. The
imitation of oriental lacquer called japanning was not
common in the colonies, and in any case was the province of
the japanner. The cabinetmaker favored oil, wax, or
varnish finishes to produce a hard, transparent, and glassy-smooth
surface.</p>
<p>To prepare the surface of the wood, colonial cabinetmakers
had planes, scrapers, glasspaper, and sandpaper&mdash;the
latter two available by the late eighteenth century and
probably much before that. Stains were used to enrich the
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
natural color and emphasize the grain of the wood, and
pulverized chalk, plaster of Paris, or the like was used to
fill the pores of coarse-grained woods.</p>
<p>Wax, usually beeswax melted and mixed with turpentine,
was cheap, easy to apply, and easy to renew. Rubbed on,
allowed to dry, and polished with a cloth&mdash;and repeated by
generations of industrious housewives or servants&mdash;wax
produced a beautiful finish, especially on mahogany or
cherry.</p>
<p>Linseed oil thinned with turpentine was frequently the
only finish applied on these and other hard, close-grained
woods. The mixture was applied generously, allowed to
stand for several hours, and wiped off. The surface was
then rubbed for hours with the bare hand or a piece of
cloth or felt, and the process was repeated again and again
until the wood showed a fine rich sheen.</p>
<p>As the wood absorbed the oil its grain rose slightly and
had to be smoothed down again between coats. Sheraton
advocated a technique that combined filling, oiling, and
smoothing in one operation: the oil was poured on and
allowed to stand, then sprinkled with fine brick dust and
rubbed with a cloth. The brick dust filled the grain and
combined with the oil to form a putty that was mildly abrasive
and would, Sheraton said, &ldquo;secure a fine polish by
continued rubbing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eighteenth-century cabinetmakers employed both oil
varnishes and spirit varnishes. The former was made by
dissolving a natural resin&mdash;copal was one of the most
commonly used&mdash;in hot oil and thinning with turpentine.
The only spirit varnish of importance was that made of
lac&mdash;in the form of stick lac, seed lac, or shell lac&mdash;dissolved
in alcohol. (Lac is the resinous secretion of an insect encrusted
on the twigs of certain East Indian trees.)</p>
<p>The application of a varnish required less labor than wax
or oil but more skill. It was flowed on, allowed to dry, and
rubbed down with a fine abrasive. This was repeated with
as many coats as might be necessary, and wax applied as a
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
final coat. Eighteenth-century Anglo-American cabinetmakers
seem to have preferred lac varnishes, particularly
shellac, for walnut furniture, wax and oil finishes for mahogany.</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small"><i>WILLIAMSBURG WORKSHOPS</i></span></h2>
<p>The elegant grounds of the Governor&rsquo;s Palace in Williamsburg
seem at first glance a most unlikely site for a cabinetmaker&rsquo;s
shop, especially in the time of Lord Dunmore.
His Majesty&rsquo;s last and unlamented viceroy in Virginia
was no basement do-it-yourselfer. But after the Revolution
his claim for the value of lost possessions included &ldquo;A
quantity of Mahogany and other Woods; with tools for
four Cabinet Makers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Dunmore&rsquo;s tools and lumber were probably
destined for the plantation he was seating near Warm
Springs as a private venture, the possibility cannot be
dismissed that some furniture work was done at the Palace.
At one spot on the grounds several items of cabinet hardware
have been excavated. And the amount of furniture in an
establishment as big as the Palace could no doubt have kept
a man busy just repairing the everyday wear and tear.</p>
<p>Whatever the situation under the royal governors,
however, the practice in 1776 was to have such work
done in the shops of the town&rsquo;s private entrepreneurs. When
Patrick Henry was about to take up residence as the independent
commonwealth&rsquo;s first chief executive, the state
government issued warrants to several Williamsburg cabinetmakers
for making or repairing Palace furniture. Honey
and Harrocks received a little more than &pound;19 for mending
28 chairs there; &pound;21 went to a certain Richard Booker
(about whose identity there remains great uncertainty) for
making some chairs; and our friend Edmund Dickinson
took in &pound;92 &ldquo;for furniture furnished the Pallace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judging by Bucktrout&rsquo;s charge of &pound;25 per dozen for
straight chairs and &pound;16 for a mahogany desk and bookcase,
Dickinson was dealing with something on the order of
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
35 chairs or their equivalent in other kinds of furniture.
It would appear that his shop, the same one where Anthony
Hay and Benjamin Bucktrout had earlier plied their craft,
was the largest such establishment in Williamsburg at the
time. It has now been reconstructed, its dimensions precisely
fixed by surviving foundations, and furnished as an
operating craft shop according to indications of the Dickinson
inventory, archaeological findings on the site, and other
information.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">

<p class="pcap"><i>This eighteenth-century woodworker&rsquo;s bench resembles its twentieth-century counterpart in
every essential feature of construction and equipment, though differing in various details.</i>
<br /><span class="jr"><span class="small">ROUBO</span></span></p>
</div>
<p>The original shop was built about 1750 on the bank of
the small stream that still flows through the Nicholson
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
Street property. Hay bought it in 1756 and some ten years
later built an addition on piers over the stream. His reason
for this seemingly awkward arrangement cannot now be
ascertained. No evidence indicates that he ever installed a
water wheel, and in any event the stream&rsquo;s flow could have
operated a lathe only in the very wettest weather.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an ill waterway, however, that flows nobody good!
This one served a double end. In the first place, it provided
a convenient place for the cabinetmakers&rsquo; apprentices to
dump the trash that accumulated in the shop. And in the
second place, the damp silt of the stream bed effectively
preserved that trash against decay, transforming it into a
twentieth-century treasure trove for today&rsquo;s archaeologists.</p>
<p>Mention has already been made of the woodworking tools
and fragments of cabinet hardware excavated at the site of
the shop. Diggers also found a few component pieces of a
table and chairs. Indeed the Anthony Hay shop, house,
kitchen, and well have proved to be the richest archaeological
dig in Williamsburg. Besides cabinet items, the
colonial artifacts include domestic glass and ceramic wares,
harness hardware, shoe buckles, garden tools, table utensils,
and a large number of gun flints. The last, along with bits
of several weapons, recall the period during the Revolution
when the shop was converted into an armory.</p>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small"><i>WORKERS IN THE SHOP</i></span></h2>
<p>The formal duties of an apprentice and his master toward
each other were spelled out in an indenture signed by each
when the apprenticeship began. Dickinson was probably
an apprentice to Hay and may have been a journeyman
employee of Bucktrout in the same shop before himself
becoming its master. In turn, Dickinson took on an apprentice
by the name of James Tyrie who would help him
and be taught the cabinetmaking craft. In the agreement
between them the master undertook that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... his said Apprentice in the same art of a Cabinet
Maker which he useth by the best means that he can
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
shall teach and instruct or cause to be taught and instructed
finding unto the said Apprentice sufficient
Meat Drink Washing Lodging &amp;c during the said
term of five years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For his part, Tyrie pledged that he:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... his said Master shall faithfully serve his secrets
keep his lawful commands every where gladly do, he
shall do no damage to his said Master nor see to be
done of others, but that he to his power shall let or
forth with give warning to his said Master of the same
he shall not waste the Goods of his said Master nor lend
them unlawfully to any he shall not commit fornication
nor contract Matrimony within the said term He shall
not play at Cards Dice Tables or any other unlawful
Games whereby his said Master may have any loss,
with his own Goods or others during the said term,
without Licence of his said Master He shall neither
buy nor sell He shall not Haunt Taverns nor Play
Houses nor absent himself from his said Masters
Service Day nor Night unlawfully But in all things
as a faithful Apprentice he shall Behave himself towards
his said Master and all his, during the said term.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What happened to Tyrie we do not know. Perhaps the
coming of the War for Independence holds the key to his
destiny; perhaps he, like many another apprentice, ran
away from his master. One of Bucktrout&rsquo;s apprentices,
David Davis, took off one day wearing a whole new suit of
clothing and new shoes. The important circumstance,
however, was that an apprenticeship of up to seven years
was the normal&mdash;indeed the only&mdash;way for a boy to gain
entry into the business world. It was also the normal source
to the master of a constantly renewed supply of cheap,
unskilled labor.</p>

<p>Three other sources of help were available to him: wage-earning
journeymen, indentured servants, and slaves&mdash;all
of whom might be skilled workers in the craft. Williamsburg
cabinetmakers advertised from time to time in the <i>Virginia
Gazette</i> for the services of capable journeymen, a circumstance
that argues both the need of the proprietors for help
and the availability of potential helpers. As to any specific
workers they may have acquired in this category, the
record is silent.</p>
<p>Other advertisements listed joiners and cabinetmakers
among the cargoes of ships bringing indentured passengers
whose services for a period were to be auctioned off to the
highest bidder or sold for a fixed fee. But no evidence
has been found that any Williamsburg cabinetmaker augmented
his work force with indentured servants.</p>
<p>Formal apprenticeship of Negro slaves was not uncommon,
and many examples can be cited of Negroes who
became skilled workers even without the formality. The
largest number in and around Williamsburg seem to have
been carpenters, but other crafts had skilled and semi-skilled
practitioners who were slaves. Peter Scott, for
example, owned &ldquo;two Negroes, bred to the Business of a
Cabinet-maker,&rdquo; and Anthony Hay owned a &ldquo;very good&rdquo;
slave cabinetmaker even after he turned from that trade to
innkeeping. However, no instance has come to light from
colonial Virginia of a Negro, even a freedman, who became
a journeyman or master of any craft.</p>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small"><i>GREENER GRASS</i></span></h2>
<p>As we have seen, Virginians who wanted fine furniture
probably ordered it from England. But competition from
across the Atlantic was not the local cabinetmaker&rsquo;s only
burden. A very large amount of furniture left the busy
shops of New England, New York, and Philadelphia in
the eighteenth century, consigned to southern ports or
the West Indies. No precise figure can be stated for the
size or importance of this coastwise trade, or for its importance
in the life of Williamsburg cabinetmakers; it
could not have made things easier for them.</p>

various tools. At the left is a type of vise called a &ldquo;donkey&rdquo;; against the wall may be seen a
large cabinet bookcase, a slant-top desk, and a chest of drawers. These would have been made
in a cabinet shop and brought here for inlay decoration.</i>

</div>
<p>Whether outside competition was the cause, or simply
the narrowness of the Virginia market in the first place,
Williamsburg cabinetmakers&mdash;like the practitioners of other
crafts&mdash;found ways to augment their incomes. Anthony
Hay became proprietor of the Raleigh Tavern and Benjamin
Bucktrout turned storekeeper and state functionary.</p>
<p>The change in Hay&rsquo;s case was clearly not motivated by
poverty; he must have been well-to-do or at any rate well
respected to have acquired backing, perhaps to the extent
of &pound;4000, to buy the Raleigh&mdash;and without selling his
house, cabinet shop, and timber yard.</p>
<p>Coffin-making was a normal part of the cabinetmaker&rsquo;s
business, and many cabinetmakers took what was the
logical next step of serving also as funeral directors. When
the popular Lord Botetourt, Governor Dunmore&rsquo;s predecessor,
died in Williamsburg, two of the town&rsquo;s cabinetmakers
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
were involved in the burial. Joshua Kendall made the three
nested coffins, and Benjamin Bucktrout provided the
hearse and four days worth of attendance in connection
with the ceremonies.</p>
<p>Bucktrout was one of the several Williamsburg cabinetmakers
who did upholstering; he also sold upholstery materials
in his shop on Francis Street. By 1774 that shop had
become a store&mdash;stocked with beer, cheese, spices, woolens
and cottons, hats, boots, women&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s shoes,
gloves, guns, pistols, saddles, whips, and a number of other
things&mdash;and Bucktrout had to advertise that he still did
cabinet work.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, Bucktrout seems to have abandoned
his own business to put all his time and effort into serving
as purveyor to the public hospitals of the state. A powder
mill he devised and erected in or near Williamsburg early
in the Revolution did not function for lack of saltpeter,
and Bucktrout&rsquo;s efforts to gain compensation or subsidy
from the Assembly were in vain.</p>
<p>Whether or not he turned Tory in 1779&mdash;and there is
one accusation on record to that effect&mdash;he was back in
Williamsburg soon after the defeat of Cornwallis, and
remained a resident of the town for another 30 years.
In 1804 he was appointed town surveyor, thereby capping
a career that for versatility was matched by its virility.
The widower Bucktrout must have been about 60 years
old when, in 1797, he took to wife a young girl by the name
of Mary Bruce. Before his death in 1812 she bore him four
children, the second receiving the name Horatio.</p>
<p>A century and a quarter later&mdash;in 1928&mdash;another Horatio
Bucktrout sold the family undertaking establishment and
thus brought to an end the Bucktrout saga in Williamsburg.
The story of cabinetmaking as an active eighteenth-century
craft in Williamsburg had ended long before, of
course.</p>

<h2 id="c16"><span class="small"><i>WILLIAMSBURG CABINETMAKERS</i></span></h2>
<p>In addition to Benjamin Bucktrout, Edmund Dickinson,
Anthony Hay, and Peter Scott&mdash;all of whom have been
discussed at some length in the preceding pages&mdash;the following
are believed to complete the list of known Williamsburg
cabinetmakers in the eighteenth century.</p>
<p class="book"><i>Richard Booker.</i> A cabinetmaker in Williamsburg in 1773,
and for three or fours years thereafter, and again or
still in 1792. The records are full of men by that name,
and their identities are difficult to sort out.</p>
<p class="book"><i>John Crump.</i> Was associated in 1775 with Richard Booker,
in what capacity is not known.</p>
<p class="book"><i>Richard Harrocks.</i> Had a shop in 1776 and 1777, part of
the time in partnership with James Honey.</p>
<p class="book"><i>James Honey</i> (died 1787). Was a house joiner rather than
cabinetmaker, but was briefly in the cabinetmaking
business with Richard Harrocks.</p>
<p class="book"><i>William Kennedy.</i> In 1769 was briefly a partner of Bucktrout;
then had his own business in the Pelham shop
on Francis Street, but his activities there are unknown.</p>
<p class="book"><i>Matthew Moody, Jr.</i> Had cabinetmaking business around
1764 or 1765 and later was a carpenter.</p>
<p class="book"><i>John Ormeston.</i> Was in Williamsburg from 1763 to 1766;
may have been a cabinetmaker or a riding-chair
maker or both.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p class="book"><i>Thomas Orton</i> (died 1778). His name appears in the records
once with the word cabinetmaker appended to it.</p>
<p class="book"><i>James Spiers.</i> Coachmaker, cabinetmaker, upholsterer from
1744 to about 1755; his shop may have been near that
of Scott.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small"><i>SUGGESTED READINGS</i></span></h2>
<p>The number of books in print on how to make furniture
is almost endless; the determined do-it-yourself antique-maker
will want to start with Joseph Moxon, <i>Mechanick
Exercises</i> (London, 1683); Thomas Chippendale, <i>Gentleman
and Cabinet-Maker&rsquo;s Director</i> (London, 1754); and Thomas
Sheraton, <i>The Cabinet Dictionary</i> (London, 1803). Among
more recent publications, space permits mention of three&mdash;not
necessarily the best or most complete, but at least
representative: F. E. Hoard and A. W. Marlow, <i>The
Cabinetmaker&rsquo;s Treasury</i> (New York, Macmillan, 1952);
Lester Margon, <i>Construction of American Furniture Treasures</i>
(New York, Home Craftsman, 1949); and Raymond F.
Yates, <i>Antique Reproductions for the Home Craftsman</i>
(New York, Whittlesey House, 1950). The last named
includes a discussion of old-time hand tools and techniques;
although not strictly concerned with cabinetmaking tools,
Henry D. Mercer, <i>Ancient Carpenters&rsquo; Tools</i> (Doylestown,
Pa., Doylestown Hist. Soc., 1929) is very informative.</p>
<p>On the historical aspects of furniture and fashion there
are, again, a multitude of books; a good start can be made
with Frank Davis, <i>A Picture History of Furniture</i> (New
York, Macmillan, 1958) and Hermann Schmitz, editor,
<i>The Encyclopedia of Furniture</i> (New York, Praeger, 1957,
new edition). On English seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
styles Ralph Edwards and L. G. G. Ramsey,
editors, <i>Connoisseur Period Guides</i> (London, The Connoisseur,
1956 <i>et seq.</i>) and Robert W. Symonds, <i>Furniture
Making in Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century England</i>
(London, The Connoisseur, 1955) are indispensable. Joseph
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
Downs, <i>American Furniture, Queen Anne and Chippendale
Periods</i> (New York, Macmillan, 1952) and Albert Sack,
<i>Fine Points of Furniture</i> (New York, Crown, 1950) are
essential for the colonial story in furniture design.</p>
<p>Local developments&mdash;Virginia and elsewhere&mdash;will be
found in the article by Helen Comstock, &ldquo;Furniture of
Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and Kentucky,&rdquo; in
<i>Antiques Magazine</i>, LXI (January, 1952). That magazine&rsquo;s
recent compilation entitled <i>The Antiques Treasury</i> (New
York, Dutton, 1959) has useful information and many
illustrations of furniture and other furnishings in Williamsburg
and in a number of other American museums and
restorations.</p>
<p>As to the craftsmen themselves and their life in colonial
times, the first place to look is Ethel Hall Bjerkoe, <i>The
Cabinetmakers of America</i> (Garden City, N. Y., Doubleday,
1957); and for light on the general, social, and economic
status of craft workers Carl Bridenbaugh, <i>The Colonial
Craftsman</i> (New York, N. Y. Univ. Press, 1950) will be
found helpful. <i>Seat of Empire</i>, by the same author; Hunter
D. Farish, editor, <i>The Journal ... of Philip Vickers Fithian</i>;
and Edmund S. Morgan, <i>Virginians at Home</i> (all published
by Colonial Williamsburg, in 1950, 1958, and 1952 respectively)
will provide lively background for the local phases
of the picture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>

<p><i>The Cabinetmaker in Eighteenth-Century Williamsburg</i>
is based largely on an unpublished monograph by Mills
Brown, formerly of the Colonial Williamsburg research
staff. It has been prepared with the assistance of Thomas

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
